# A-B Testing
This project will be a beginners framework to A/B testing, what to do, how to do it and how to get the most useful results for your business question.

# The Scenario
An online bicycle store has changed its home page interface to encourage visitors to click through to its loyalty programme sign-up page. It hopes the new interface will encourage more visitors to access the loyalty programme page, to see what benefits the programme brings, and to sign up. The current click-through rate (CTR) is around 50% annually, and the company hopes the new design will push this to at least 55%.
