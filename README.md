# A-B Testing
This project will be a beginners framework to A/B testing, what to do, how to do it and how to get the most useful results for your business question.

## The Scenario
An online bicycle store has changed its home page interface to encourage visitors to click through to its loyalty programme sign-up page. It hopes the new interface will encourage more visitors to access the loyalty programme page, to see what benefits the programme brings, and to sign up. The current click-through rate (CTR) is around 50% annually, and the company hopes the new design will push this to at least 55%.

## The Objective
Run an A/B test on the data to measure the significance of the interface change based on CTR to the loyalty programme page. Users on the server ID1 are the treatment group and those on ID2 and ID3 are the control groups.
